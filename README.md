Installing and Compiling from Source
------------

The easiest way to start using Weasel is to download it off the [releases](https://github.com/WeaselChess/Weasel/releases) page.


If you're looking to compile from source, you'll need the following:

  * [Go](https://golang.org) installed and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  * A chess frontend application that can communicate over UCI
